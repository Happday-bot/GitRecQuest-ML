## üìú How It Works

### üïµÔ∏è 1. Scraping LinkedIn Jobs

- The **scraper.py** fetches job listings based on a given keyword.
- It requires the correct selectors from the HTML of Linkedin
- The extracted data includes:
  - Job Title
  - Company Name
  - Job Description

### üéØ 2. Resume Matching

- The **resume_matcher.py** applies **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** to measure how well a resume aligns with a job description.
- Outputs:
  - **Match Score** (0-1 scale)
  - **Missing Skills** (skills in the job description but absent in the resume)

### üñ•Ô∏è 3. Streamlit UI  

The **frontend/app.py** provides a web-based UI for user-friendly interaction.  
- Upload a resume in **PDF or TXT** format (*PDF support is not fully functional yet*).  
- Enter a **job keyword** to search LinkedIn.  
- View **job listings ranked by match score**.  
- Use the **advanced search function** (*currently not working*).

## ü´µ Your Part In This

- The project currently opens the browser physically which can be avoided
- Some of the css selectors for scraping the job listings are missing without which the scraper wont function
- You'll have to dive into the inspect menu in your browser for Linkedin to find those selectors
- The selectors could be the class or the data test id
- optionally : You could always imporve the interface and the model performance, as well as make the scraper target more specific areas of interest
